## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔍 Intelligent Fuzzy Matching**: Scans local ComfyUI model directories and looks for similar files (ignoring case, extensions, or minor naming differences) with similarity confidence scores.
- **☁️ Multi-Source Cloud Downloader**: Searches for and downloads missing files from **CivitAI**, **HuggingFace**, **CivArchive**, **Lora Manager Archive**, and the **ComfyUI-Manager** model database.
- **🔄 In-Place Workflow Updater**: Safely replaces model names and paths in your current workflow (supporting nested subgraphs and custom nodes like *rgthree's Power Lora Loader* or *LoraManager*).
- **📥 Background Download Manager**: Downloads models asynchronously directly to the correct directories (`checkpoints`, `loras`, `vae`, etc.) with speed tracking, file size display, progress bars, and cancel support.
- **🕵️ Loaded Models Inspector**: A dedicated tab displaying all models used in the active workflow, including their strength, physical paths, and disk availability status.
- **📂 Open Containing Folder**: Quickly opens Windows Explorer and selects/highlights the model file directly from the interface.

## 🛠️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Load Workflow**: Load any workflow JSON or image into ComfyUI.
2. **Detection**: If the workflow references model files that are missing from your directories, the extension alerts you immediately.
3. **Resolve**:
   - **Local Search**: Click the local search button to find similar filenames you already have on disk (e.g., if they were moved to a different subfolder).
   - **Online Search**: If the file isn't on disk, search for it online (e.g., on CivitAI via its SHA256 file hash or text search).
4. **Download or Link**:
   - Click **Download** to asynchronously download the model in the background directly into the correct ComfyUI folder.
   - Or select a local alternative suggested by the Fuzzy Matching algorithm.
5. **Apply**: Click the apply button to update the ComfyUI workflow with the new, correct model paths. You're ready to click *Queue Prompt*!

## 📂 Supported Nodes & Model Types

Model Resolver supports standard ComfyUI mechanisms as well as custom implementations of popular loader nodes:
* **Standard loaders**: CheckpointLoader, LoraLoader, VAELoader, ControlNetLoader, UpscaleModelLoader, etc.
* **Advanced loaders**: Nodes from the `LoraManager` suite (`LoraLoaderV2`, `Lora Loader`, `Lora Stacker`), `rgthree` (`Power Lora Loader`), and LTX-Video nodes.
* **Subgraphs**: Full support for scanning and updating nodes inside nested group subgraphs.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Credentials (Settings)

In the extension settings panel, you can configure API keys and authorization tokens, which are required for downloading private models or files requiring authentication:
* **CivitAI API Key & Session Token**: Allows downloading models from CivitAI (including those marked as NSFW or requiring accepted terms of service).
* **HuggingFace Token**: Required for downloading gated or private models from HuggingFace.
* **Brave Search API Key**: An optional key used as a fallback search mechanism to discover HuggingFace download links via Brave search.

> [!TIP]
> The extension includes a built-in connection tester that allows you to instantly verify the validity of your tokens directly in the settings panel.
